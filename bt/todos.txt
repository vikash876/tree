Geeks for geeks 1st page of tree excercise.
Easy ones.
1. Traversal in recursive manner.                       times(1) rank(2)
2. Traversal in iterative manner.                       preorder - times(0) rank(unknown),
                                                        inorder  - times(0) rank(unknown),
                                                        postorder- times(1) rank(8)
3. size of a tree (node count).                         times(1) rank(4)
4. Maximum depth or height of a tree. (Number of edges) times(1) rank(6)
5. Check if both trees are identical.                   times(0) rank(unknown)
6. Delete a tree.                                       times(0) rank(unknown)
7. Mirror a binary tree.                                times(0) rank(unknown)
8. Print out all root to leaf paths.                    times(0) rank(unknown)
9. Find lowest common ansector of a node.               times(0) rank(unknown)
10.Level order traversal.                               times(0) rank(unknown)
11.Count leaf nodes in a binary tree.                   times(0) rank(unknown)
12.Check if given tree is a bst.                        times(0) rank(unknown)
